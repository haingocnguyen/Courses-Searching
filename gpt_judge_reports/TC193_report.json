    "reason": "The query is a whimsical, fantasy-themed statement without specific educational requests or course-related terms. It aligns with GENERAL_CHAT examples like 'become a dragon trainer' and 'magical powers course' (though those are in COURSE_SEARCH). However, the lack of concrete educational topics or action words like 'find,' 'search,' or 'recommend' makes it more casual and less aligned with COURSE_SEARCH.",

It is clear and professionally toned, providing guidance on finding courses. However, it is not helpful in achieving the user's goal and lacks completeness as it does not offer any actionable information. The response hallucinates by introducing a context about courses, which was not requested by the user.",
