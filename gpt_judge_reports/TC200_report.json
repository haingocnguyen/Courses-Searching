    "reason": "The query is a vague, casual inquiry about a fictional concept (holiday to Mars) without specific educational or course-related details. It aligns with GENERAL_CHAT examples like 'tell me a funny joke please' or 'I am feeling tired today', which are non-educational, casual, or abstract.",

    "reasoning": "The predicted intent 'general_chat' is semantically correct for the user query as it indicates a general conversation topic. The query is straightforward and unambiguous, aligning perfectly with the predicted intent.

    "reasoning": "The response is not relevant to the user's query about Mars holidays, making it unhelpful. However, it is clear, well-structured, and maintains a professional tone. The response lacks completeness as it fails to provide any information related to Mars holidays. It hallucinates by introducing a course-related context where none was requested.",
