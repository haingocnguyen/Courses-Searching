However, the response was clear, well-structured, and maintained a professional tone. It lacked helpfulness as it did not provide any guidance or actionable information. The response was incomplete as it failed to offer any relevant information. The major issue was the hallucination score, as the system introduced a completely unrelated topic of finding courses, which is false and unsupported in the context of the user query.",
