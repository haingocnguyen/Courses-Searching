    "reasoning": "The response is mostly relevant as it acknowledges the user's query about typing gibberish. It provides a general introduction to the system's capabilities, which is somewhat helpful but lacks direct guidance on the specific query. The response is clear and well-structured, maintaining a professional tone throughout. However, it falls short in completeness by not addressing the gibberish aspect directly. There are no hallucinations as the response sticks to factual information.",
