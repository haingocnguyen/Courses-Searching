    "reason": "The query involves a fantasy-themed request ('summon a dragon') and a casual question ('can you?'), aligning with GENERAL_CHAT examples like 'become a dragon trainer' (though that's in COURSE_SEARCH, the phrasing here is more whimsical and less about course-specific action words). The lack of clear educational topic or action verbs like 'find', 'recommend', or 'show' further points to GENERAL_CHAT.",

    "reasoning": "The predicted intent 'general_chat' is a perfect match for the user query as it falls under a general conversational category. The query is not seeking a specific action or information but rather engaging in a casual conversation. The confidence score being high is appropriate as the query is straightforward and unambiguous.",

    "reasoning": "The response lacks relevance as it completely ignores the user's query about summoning a dragon for a birthday party. While the response is clear and professionally toned, it is unhelpful and incomplete in addressing the user's needs. The major weakness is the complete disregard for the user's query, leading to a low overall score.",
