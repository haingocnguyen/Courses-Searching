    "reason": "The query involves a playful, creative request (a lullaby in binary code) that aligns with casual conversation and fantasy topics in GENERAL_CHAT examples. It lacks specific educational/action-oriented keywords typical of COURSE_SEARCH, and instead focuses on a whimsical interaction.",

    "reasoning": "The predicted intent 'general_chat' is semantically correct for the user query as it falls under a general chat category. The query is clear and unambiguous, hence the high confidence level is appropriate. Overall, the system performed well in accurately identifying the intent with a high confidence level.",
