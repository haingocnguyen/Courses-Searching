    "reason": "The query contains a whimsical, fantasy-themed request ('solve world peace') that aligns with GENERAL_CHAT examples like 'become a dragon trainer' or 'magical powers course'. It lacks specific educational topics or action words typical of COURSE_SEARCH, and instead reflects casual, imaginative conversation.",

    "reasoning": "The predicted intent 'general_chat' is semantically correct for the user query as it falls under a general conversational category. The confidence score being high is appropriate since the query is straightforward and unambiguous, aligning well with the predicted intent.

However, it maintained a clear and professional tone. The response lacked helpfulness as it did not provide any guidance or next steps for the user. It was incomplete in not offering any information related to the user's query. The response hallucinated by introducing the context of finding courses, which was not present in the user query.",
