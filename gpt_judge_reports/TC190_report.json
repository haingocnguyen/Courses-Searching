The query is ambiguous and open-ended, making 'general_chat' an appropriate intent.

It scores low on helpfulness as it fails to guide the user or provide any actionable information. However, the response is clear, well-structured, and maintains a professional tone. It is incomplete as it does not address the user's query at all. The response hallucinates by introducing the topic of finding courses, which was not requested by the user.",
