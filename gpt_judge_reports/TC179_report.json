    "reasoning": "The response partially addresses the user's query by acknowledging the chatbot's purpose but fails to engage in small talk. It lacks actionable information or guidance, making it minimally helpful. The clarity is decent with a clear structure and language. However, the response is incomplete as it does not provide any information on small talk with chatbots. The professional tone is maintained throughout. The response hallucinates by introducing the concept of finding courses, which was not relevant to the user query.",
