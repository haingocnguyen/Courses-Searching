It lacks helpfulness as it does not provide any actionable information or guidance. However, the response is clear and well-structured, maintaining a professional tone throughout. It is incomplete as it does not offer any information related to the user's query. The major issue is the hallucination score, as the system claims to help find courses but provides no results, leading to unsupported information.",
