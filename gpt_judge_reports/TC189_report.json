While it's not a casual greeting, it doesn't align with course-related terms or actions in the COURSE_SEARCH category. The action 'book' and the context of a flight are more aligned with general conversation rather than educational course searches.",

    "reasoning": "The predicted intent 'general_chat' is semantically correct for the user query as it is a general conversation request rather than a specific flight booking intent. The confidence score being medium is appropriate as the query involves a unique request to book a flight to Mars, which could introduce some ambiguity. Overall, the system performed well in accurately identifying the intent with a reasonable confidence level.",
